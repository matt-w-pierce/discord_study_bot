By definition, it does NOT display efficacy<!>Continuous administration of an antagonist may cause _______ regulation of the target receptors.|Up<!>___________ antagonism is reversible.|Competitive<!>If a patient receives a competitive antagonist, the dose response curve for the agonist shifts to the _________ .|Right<!>T/F: Increasing the concentration of the agonist can overcome competitive antagonism, but since it requires more drug molecules to achieve a desired clinical effect, the dose response curve would reflect a reduction in potency.|True<!>_______ antagonism is non-reversible, where antagonists permanently bind to a receptor via covalent bonding.|Non-Competitive<!>T/F: Increasing the concentration of the agonist can overcome non-competitive antagonism|False; Their effects cannot be overcome by increasing the concentration of an agonist, however, this shifts the dose response curve for the agonist down so it resembles a partial-agonist<!>The effects of aa non-competitive antagonist can only be reversed by producing new _________ .|Receptors<!>______ is an example of a non-competitive antagonist.|Aspirin<!>An _________ agonist binds to the receptor and causes the opposite effect to that of a full agonist.|Inverse<!>Inverse Agonists are said to have _________ efficacy.|Negative<!>___________ : the effect of two drugs given at the same time are added to each other (i.e. 1 + 1 = 2)|Addition<!>__________ : the effects of two drugs given at the same time is greater than the sum of their individual effects (i.e. 1 + 1 = 3)|Synergism<!>___________ : the effect of one drug is enhanced by a drug that has no effect of its own (i.e. 1 + 0 = 3)|Potentiation<!>_____________ : simultaneous administration of one drug cancels the effect of a second drug (i.e. 1 + 1 = 0)|Antagonism<!>The _______ is the dose that will produce death in 50% of the population.|LD50<!>___________ = LD50 / ED50|Therapeutic Index<!>The __________ index is a measure of drug safety and is the ratio between LD50 and ED50.|Therapeutic<!>A drug with a _________ therapeutic index has a narrow margin of safety.|Narrow<!>T/F: A drug with a wide therapeutic index has a narrow margin of safety|False;
