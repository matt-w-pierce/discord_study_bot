Sub-anesthetic doses of IHA and IVA<!>Name that Respiratory Reflex: When lung volume is too small, this reflex helps prevent atelectasis by stimulating the patient to take a deep breath|Hering-Breuer Deflation Reflex<!>Name that Respiratory Reflex: Causes newborn baby to take first breath|Paradoxical Reflex of the Head<!>Name that Respiratory Reflex: Opposite of the Hering-Breuer Inflation Reflex|Hering-Breuer Deflation Reflex<!>Name that Respiratory Reflex: When lung inflation is >1.5L above FRC, this reflex "turns off" the dorsal respiratory center. Said another way, it stops further inspiration|Hering-Breuer Inflation Reflex<!>Name that Respiratory Reflex: Provides a similar function as the pneumotaxic center|Hering-Breuer Inflation Reflex<!>Name that Respiratory Reflex: The reflex is not active during normal inspiration|Hering-Breuer Inflation Reflex<!>Name that Respiratory Reflex: causes tachypnea in PE or CHF|J Receptor Reflex<!>The pulmonary vascular bed is the only region in the body that responds to hypoxia with _______________________ .|Vasaconstriction.<!>Name that Respiratory Reflex: local reaction that occurs in response to a reduction in alveolar oxygen tension (NOT PaO2)|Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction<!>HPV selectively increases the ____________ in poorly ventilated areas to minimize shunt flow to these regions. the response begins within seconds and achieves its full effect in about ____ minutes.|PVR; 15<!>Factors that Impair HPV (5)|1. Volatile anesthetics >1.5 MAC reduce the effectiveness of HPV (some texts say 1 MAC)
2. Vasodilators (PDE-inhibitors, Dobutamine and some CCB)
3. Vasoconstrictors 
4. Hypervolemia (LAP >25mmHg) 
5. Excessive PEEP<!>HPV is a protective mechanism that minimizes shunt flow during atelectasis or during ________ .|OLV<!>Stretch receptors in the smooth airway muscle transduce pressure conditions inside the airway. they transmit this information along the _______ nerve to the __________________.|Vagus; DRG<!>T/F: IV anesthetics do NOT affect HPV or increase shunt (i.e. ketamine, propofol, fentanyl, etc.)|True<!>
