AE: ONLY reverses steroidals (-oniums)"
How does neostigmine work?,"It is an alternate substrate, it acts like ACh. AChE is busy breaking down neostigmine SLOWLY, it can't break down ACh. This allows ACh to build up in the synapse, and eventually take the place of the paralytic at the receptors due to the law of mass action"
Why can't you use Edrophonium for deep blocks?,It does not have 100% efficacy
Why are the max doses of the reversal agents relevant?,"Because at the max dose, 100% inhibition of AChE occurs. Anything above this dose will only increase side effects. If the max dose doesn't work, the reversal isn't the issue!"
Why do we give glycopyrrolate with neostigmine?,"Neostigmine allows ACh to build up EVERYWHERE, including muscarinic receptors in the parasympathetic nervous system - this will cause a vagal effect (bradycardia, increased GI motility, bronchoconstriction)
Glyco will counteract the vagal effect at the muscarinic receptors (anti-cholinergics should really be called anti-muscarinics!)"
What type of drug is Sugammadex? How does it work?,"It is a Selective Relaxant Binding Agent (SRBA) - also called an extended cyclodextrin

"There are 2 populations of nicotinic receptors at the NMJ, which do non-depolarizing NMBs work on and which do succinylcholine work on?","ND-NMBD compete with ACh for post-synaptic alpha subunits
Succ produces depolarization, therefore decreasing the sensitivity of post-synaptic nicotinic ACh receptors and inactivation of Na channels"
Decreased response to a single twitch is caused by blockade of _______ nicotinic ACh receptors?,Post-synaptic
Fade in response to TOF is caused by blockade of _______ nicotinic ACh receptors?,Pre-synaptic
Why does Succ have rapid onset and ultrashort duration of action?,Rapid hydrolysis by plasma cholinesterase (butyrylcholinesterase)

"If myalgia is a concern or the patient is very muscular, what can you do when giving succ to prevent fasciculation?",Give small dose of intermediate acting ND-NMBD
How fast can a high dose (RSI) of Roc create intubating conditions?,60 seconds
